# Web3 Game Simulator: "Blockchain Universe"

This directory hosts the skeleton implementation of a Web3-based game
simulator where players develop satirical blockchain projects over a
compressed timeline of 2010â€“2025. The game is planned as a year-long
run that eventually "catches up" with real time and continues in a
live-service mode.

The current repository contains only a structural prototype. Refer to
`docs/technical_plan.md` for the full design document.
