# Project Concept

"Blockchain Universe" is a humorous casual Web3 game where each player
creates and evolves a fictional blockchain from the early 2010s
through 2025. The gameplay mixes satire, memes and simplified economic
mechanics. Dynamic AI-driven events and a global leaderboard encourage
competition. The project follows a free-to-play model with optional
purchases and token rewards for top players.
