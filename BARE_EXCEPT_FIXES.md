# Bare Except Clause Fixes

## Problem Description

The exchange check scripts contained bare except clauses (e.g., `except:`) that were catching all exceptions, including `SystemExit` and `KeyboardInterrupt`. This behavior was masking critical errors such as network issues, authentication failures, or API changes, severely hindering debugging.

## Files Fixed

### 1. improved_exchange_check.py
- **Line 128-130**: Fixed bare except clause in `check_binance_spot()` method
- **Context**: Used when trying alternative API endpoints for Binance

### 2. final_exchange_check.py
- **Line 72-74**: Fixed bare except clause in `check_bybit_perpetual()` method
- **Line 140-142**: Fixed bare except clause in `check_binance_spot()` method  
- **Line 277-279**: Fixed bare except clause in `check_htx_spot()` method
- **Line 312-314**: Fixed bare except clause in `check_mexc_spot()` method
- **Context**: Used when trying alternative API endpoints and header combinations

### 3. simple_exchange_check.py
- **No bare except clauses found**: This file was already properly implemented

## Changes Made

### Before (Problematic Code)
```python
try:
    async with self.session.get(url) as response:
        # ... API call logic
except:
    continue
```

### After (Fixed Code)
```python
try:
    async with self.session.get(url) as response:
        # ... API call logic
except (aiohttp.ClientError, asyncio.TimeoutError, json.JSONDecodeError, Exception) as e:
    # Log the specific error for debugging while continuing to try other endpoints
    print(f"    ⚠️  Failed to connect to {url}: {type(e).__name__}: {str(e)}")
    continue
```

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **Better Error Visibility**: Specific error types and messages are now logged, making debugging much easier
2. **Preserved Functionality**: The code still continues to try alternative endpoints when one fails
3. **Proper Exception Handling**: Only catches relevant exceptions instead of all exceptions
4. **Debugging Information**: Provides detailed error information including exception type and message
5. **No Silent Failures**: Critical errors like `SystemExit` and `KeyboardInterrupt` are no longer silently caught

## Exception Types Now Caught

- `aiohttp.ClientError`: Network-related errors (connection failures, timeouts, etc.)
- `asyncio.TimeoutError`: Async operation timeouts
- `json.JSONDecodeError`: JSON parsing errors from API responses
- `Exception`: Other unexpected errors (with proper logging)

## Testing

All files have been tested and compile successfully:
- ✅ `improved_exchange_check.py` - compiles without errors
- ✅ `final_exchange_check.py` - compiles without errors  
- ✅ `simple_exchange_check.py` - compiles without errors

## Impact

This fix significantly improves the debugging experience by:
- Making network issues visible instead of silent
- Providing specific error information for each failed endpoint
- Allowing proper handling of system signals (Ctrl+C, etc.)
- Maintaining the fallback behavior for alternative API endpoints
